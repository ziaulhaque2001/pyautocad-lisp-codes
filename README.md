The goal of this project is to fully automate electrical wiring design and documentation in AutoCAD using custom AutoLISP and Python-assisted workflows. The system is designed to intelligently handle switchboard (SB) and panel/load (PL) blocks, automatically creating wire connections, recording XData and attributes, and generating wiring chains with minimal manual input. My workflow includes multiple modes — such as chain-based wiring, wire arc creation, and continuous wiring — to cover various design scenarios. The project emphasizes accurate data capture, automatic text file generation for wiring reports, and robust handling of issues like blocks not starting or ending at base points. Ultimately, the objective is to create a reliable, end-to-end automated tool that eliminates repetitive drafting tasks, reduces human error, and streamlines electrical schematic documentation, making complex wiring projects faster, more consistent, and fully traceable.
